    <h1>2020 United States Presidential Election Statistics</h1>
    <section>
        <p>The 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, held on November 3rd, was one of the most contentious and closely-watched in recent history. Incumbent President Donald J. Trump of the Republican Party vied for a second term against the Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Amidst the challenges of a global pandemic and significant civil unrest, this election saw an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots and brought issues like racial equality, public health, and economic recovery to the forefront of the national conversation.</p>

        <p>The results of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election were pivotal. The choropleth map showcases how each state voted, with blue representing states that favored Biden and red representing those that favored Trump. The subsequent bar chart provides a clear visualization of the Electoral College votes each candidate secured. The race to 270 votes is the key to a Presidential victory, and this visualization offers a clear breakdown of that race.</p>

        <p>The bubble chart provides insights into the voting margins of each state, allowing users to sort data by VEP and region. This visualization highlights swing states as well as historical Democratic and Republican strongholds, offering a comprehensive view of the U.S. political landscape.</p>

    <section>
        <p>Approval ratings play a crucial role in predicting election outcomes. This visualization traces the approval rating trend of both Biden and Trump leading up to the election. Key events, such as Trump's declaration of a state of emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic, the tragic death of George Floyd, and Trump's own COVID-19 diagnosis, significantly influenced these ratings.</p>
    </section>

    <div id="symbol_map5"></div>
    <section>
        <p>Post-election, the House of Representatives saw the Democrats secure a majority with 222 seats to the Republicans' 213. This majority means the Democrats have the power to drive legislative decisions and set the agenda in the House, a significant advantage in governing and policy-making.</p>
    </section>

    <div id="symbol_map6"></div>
    <section>
        <p>The Senate's composition was another focal point of the 2020 elections. With 48 Democrats, 50 Republicans, and 2 Independents, the balance of power was precarious. However, as the Democrats are in caucus with the Independents, and the Vice President (a Democrat) holds the tie-breaking vote, they effectively have a majority of 51 to 50, allowing them a slim margin to advance their legislative priorities.</p>
    </section>

    <div id="symbol_map7"></div>
    <section>
        <p>Since taking office, President Biden's approval rating has been under scrutiny. Key events, including the Afghanistan withdrawal, the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, and rising inflation, have seen his approval rating fluctuate. This visualization tracks these changes, offering a glimpse into public sentiment during his tenure.</p>
    </section>

    <div id="symbol_map8"></div>
    <section>
        <p>As attention turns to future elections, the approval ratings of potential Republican candidates come into focus. Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis emerge as frontrunners, with notable figures like Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, Mike Pence, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also in the mix. This visualization provides a snapshot of the current political climate within the Republican Party, setting the stage for what promises to be another closely-watched election cycle.</p>
