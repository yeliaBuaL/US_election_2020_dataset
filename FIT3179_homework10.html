        <h2>Understanding the Bubble Chart</h2>
        <p>The bubble chart provides a detailed visualization of voting margins across different states. By analyzing the size and color of each bubble, you can gauge the voting preference of each state at a glance. Notably, the chart highlights swing states, which do not have a consistent pattern of voting for one particular party. These states played a crucial role in determining the election outcome. Additionally, the chart showcases states that have historically been strongholds for the Democratic and Republican parties.</p>

        <h2>Candidate Approval Ratings Before the Election</h2>
        <p>Approval ratings offer insight into the public's perception of a candidate's performance and likability. Leading up to the election, both candidates experienced fluctuations in their ratings due to various events. President Trump's declaration of a state of emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic and his subsequent positive test for the virus negatively impacted his approval ratings. In contrast, the tragic death of George Floyd and the ensuing calls for racial justice positively influenced Biden's ratings as he was seen as a proponent for change and unity.</p>

        <h2>House of Representatives Post-Election</h2>
        <p>Following the election, the Democrats secured a majority in the House of Representatives with 222 seats, while the Republicans held 213 seats.

        <h2>Senate Dynamics</h2>
        <p>The U.S. Senate, post-election, comprised 48 Democrats, 50 Republicans, and 2 Independents. Though the Republicans had a numerical advantage, the two Independent senators caucused with the Democrats. Furthermore, with the Vice President's tie-breaking vote, the Democrats effectively held a slim majority of 51 to 50, allowing them to drive legislative decisions, confirm presidential appointments, and more.</p>

These events and their repercussions have been pivotal in shaping public opinion about the Biden administration's competence and decision-making.</p>
